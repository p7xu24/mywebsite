	Write the algorithm that would prompt a user to guess a number beween 1 and 10. The program 
	should tell the user if the guess is too high or too low. If the guess is correct, the program should alert how 
	many guess the user took. 
	
	1. create(declare) three variables: rand (for random number)
										usersGuess (the guess that the user makes)
										numOfGuesses (increases by 1 each time the user makes another guess)
										etc...
	2. create loop While (attempts!==randomNumber)Compare the user's guess with the generated number.
	3. Return feedback if the users number is too high or low. 
	4. Keep track of the number of guesses. 
	5. If they get it correct, tell them and tell them how many tries it took.
