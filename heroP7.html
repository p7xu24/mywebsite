 <h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Walter Hartwell White was born on September 7, 1958. His father died of Huntington's disease early in his life and he 
delved deep into his studies to cope. Walter studied at Caltech proving to be a brilliant chemist, specializing
in crystallography.  In 1985, Walt's groundbreaking research found its way to a project that was eventually awarded the
Nobel Prize in Chemistry. He also co-founded Gray Matter Technologies which went on to become a multi-billion dollar corporation 
but Walter saw little profit as he sold his share for a mere $5,000.

  <h2> Why Walter White is my Hero</h2>
 <p>
Walter White is the chemistry teacher at J. P. Wynne High School. I admire his vast knowledge as a chemist as well as his dedication to his students and 
family. As a family man, Walter cares for his son, Walter White Jr. who suffers from Cerebral Palsy. I also admire Walter's self relience. When
diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, Walter worked even more hours, starting his business to pay the bills. Eventually his hard work lead to a 80 milion
dollar fortune.
